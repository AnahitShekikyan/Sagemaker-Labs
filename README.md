# Important! :warning::warning::warning:
‚ùó When asked to login to a Canvas account, you will need to create a new account. This is the AWS Canvas account, and will not be the same as your USD Canvas account.

- In AWS Learner Labs once you reach $100 all of your code will be automatically destroyed. In addition, AWS Learner Labs has occasional issues where your environment is not accessible.
- **Be sure that you are ALWAYS storing your code in GitHub. You will not be given extra time to complete an assignment due to your Learner Lab deleting your code.**
- In order to make it easy to complete labs and work on your project, it is highly reccomended that you follow the below process twice, once for a `lab` user and once for a `project` user (be sure you are saving your work from the `project` user in your own GitHub repository.

## 5. Clone this GitHub Repo in the Terminal

Within the Terminal, run the following:

```
cd ~ && git clone -b main https://github.com/mads508/labs.git

```

If you see an error like the following, just re-run the command again until it works:
```
fatal: Unable to create '.git/index.lock': File exists.

Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.
an editor opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes
are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process
may have crashed in this repository earlier:
remove the file manually to continue.
```
_Note:  Just re-run the command again until it works._

## 6. Navigate to Lab 01
- On the Left hand side click the icon of the folder
- Click `labs`
- Click `01_oreilly_book`
- Double Click `01_Setup_Dependencies.ipynb`
- **NEW FOR 2024** When you open a new file, Sagemaker will ask you to pick an environment. You must change the image to `Data Science 2.0` or the labs in this class will not run.
